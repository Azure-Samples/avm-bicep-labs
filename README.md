### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI: [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli#install-or-update)
- An Azure Subscription: [Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/search/)

### Quickstart

The instructions for these samples are in the form of Labs. Follow along with them to get up and running.

## Demo / Lab

### Part 0 - Get the lab files

In this part, we are going to get a local copy of the lab files for use in the rest of the lab.

1. Create a new root folder for the lab in a location of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the new folder.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/avm-bicep-labs` to clone the lab files into the new folder; they will be in a subfolder called `avm-bicep-labs`.

Your file structure should now look like this:

```plaintext
ðŸ“‚avm-bicep-labs
â”£ ðŸ“‚lab01
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmain.bicep
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œdependencies.bicep
â”— ðŸ“‚lab02
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmain.bicep
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œdependencies.bicep
â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
```

### Lab 01
